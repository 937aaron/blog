## Pair Programming

Pair programing is a technique in which two programmers
share a computer while they code. There are 2 roles in pair programming. The Driver and the Navigator. The driver is the only person on the computer, doing the coding, using the mouse and keyboard. The navigator goes over the code as the driver is typing, correcting mistakes, giving suggestions and bouncing ideas. The roles are switched often.


The biggest advantage I have found in my research of Pair Programming is time. Having 4 eyes debugging in real time would seem to cut down the amount of mistakes and speed up the process of actual coding. Another advantage would be a shared pool of knowledge. Two heads are better than one. The pair sharing ideas, collaborating, can allow for solutions the individual may have not thought of on their own or would have had to seek from outside sources.

The biggest disadvantage I believe would be the concern that the pair does not work well together. When working with others this is always a risk. It could result in one half of the pair not giving input and one person doing all the work. Any breakdown in communication from the pair would certainly be disastrous.
