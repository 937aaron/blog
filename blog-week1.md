#Week 1
##The Growth Mindset
Simply put the two mindsets can be described as
###The fixed mindset.
  Someone's abilities are set in stone. They are naturally gifted and their talents are inherit.
###The Growth mindset
  That anyone can learn anything. It rewards the persons actions taken to learn something instead of the knowledge.  


  I have suffered from the fixed mindset most of my life. I tend to pick up something very quickly but when I struggle with something I can be quick to give up (ie organic chemistry) while using the excuse "my brain just isn't made this way".



  At the Iron Yard I think it is very good to keep in mind the ideas of The Growth Mindset. There will be times where things just click and there will be times where they don't (I'm looking at you javascript). Especially with this short and accelerated program getting caught up in my own head is a concern.
